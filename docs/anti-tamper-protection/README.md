The game has an anti-tamper mechanism built in. Any modification to the game files provokes the game to drop any multiplayer games. It kicks all the clients and only the host joins. This means that for single-player games, the anti-tamper mechanism is not relevant.

Defeating this mechanism would allow us to:
- Make multiplayer mods.
- Use an alternative EOS library, in case Epic Games closes (or, more realistically, the VHS EOS project losses access )
- Fully preserve the game for history. Allowing it to strip any DRM protections

However, that's everything we know about this mechanism. We don't know anything about where this mechanism is even hosted. Does it come from Easy Anti-Cheat? I'd say it doesn't because it triggers with EAC disabled. But maybe the game is expecting something from EAC to check for it.
It remains a mystery
